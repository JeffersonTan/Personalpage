</div>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i320nh0g12">What is Proton?</h1>
<p>Now for those who are not familiar with Linux in the first place, we need to learn about Proton first. Well, usually if you want to play a game on Windows, you just press start. However, games aren't usually made with Linux in mind (especially for more popular titles). This is where Proton comes in.</p>
<p>What is it you may ask? In simple terms, Proton is a compatibility layer that allows Windows programs to run on Linux and it works by translating Windows calls and APIs into something that Linux understands. It is actually based off a project called WINE (which funnily enough stands for WINE is not an emulator) that has patches and libraries added from Valve to improve performance for games.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1i3219b3015">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>To make Windows games and programs work, Proton needs to create a "prefix" which is a small sandboxed environment that Windows programs run. Usually this prefix contains folder structures that looks similar to a Windows install but with much less stuff in them because Windows programs expect certain folders to exist at a certain location.</p>
<p>If you're using Steam (which I assume you do), this prefix is usually located in this path:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/</code></pre>
<p>It contains prefixes for all of your Steam games that requires Proton to run. For BeamNG specifically, it's located in a folder called "284160".</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i32ae26f1q">Actually installing the mods</h1>
<p>From here on, the process for installing mods for BeamNG should be similar to how you install it on Windows.</p>
<p>First, we head over to BeamNG's prefix folder:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code># Replace $USER with your username, of course
/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c</code></pre>
<p>In the drive_c folder, you'll notice a few familiar folders:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44.png" alt="A picture of the folder structure inside the prefix." width="980" height="180" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-xs.webp 300w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-sm.webp 480w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-md.webp 768w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-lg.webp 1024w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-xl.webp 1360w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-2xl.webp 1600w">
<figcaption >Windows system folder structure</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next, we'll navigate to this path:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code>/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/BeamNG.drive/</code></pre>
<p>If you've played previous versions of BeamNG before, you'll notice a few folders like this:</p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45.png" alt="Folders of different BeamNG versions" width="642" height="148" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-xs.webp 300w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-sm.webp 480w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-md.webp 768w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-lg.webp 1024w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-xl.webp 1360w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption >Folders named after the game's versions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then, open the folder for the latest version of the game and that's where your mods folder resides. You can then simply copy-paste or drag and drop your mods in the folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait, does this mean I can just migrate my mods from Windows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. You can copy all the mods you had from Windows if you're dual-booting Linux, or better yet, you can create a symlink so you don't have a bunch of duplicate files eating precious disk space.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>To summarise everything, installing mods for BeamNG in Linux isn't too different from Windows. The mods folder is located in a slightly different location and you can simply copy your desired mods into the folder.</p>

<h1 id="mcetoc_1i2teo7fa68">What is Umami?</h1>
<p>So, what is this Umami thing anyways? Umami is a FOSS (Free and Open-Source) and privacy-focused web analytics uhh.. thing. It helps web admins view visitor data and whatnot for their websites.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(and get a better explanation)</span>, you can check out their website <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i2teo7fa69">Why Umami?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not just use Google Analytics or CloudFlare like any other sane person?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you may wonder why I chose this over any other analytics solution like Google Analytics. It's because I care about my privacy and the privacy of visitors like you guys and gals who visit this website, plus, I'm not a big fan of Google anyways.</p>
<p>Another reason is that I can self-host Umami on my home server. I'll probably show my server some other time, but being able to self-host means that I control the data instead of some big corp. If you're curious, you can check out the analytics data over <a href="https://stats.jeffersontan.xyz/share/Dq1Qz7b4KYzxvSAb/jeffersontan.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i2tg2f5u8u">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So in short, Umami is an analytics platform that's free and respects users' privacy. I chose it because I don't want to use Google and because I can host Umami myself on my own server.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you guys think Umami is good? Or are there any better alternatives? Let me know, wait, you can't lol. I haven't added a comments system for this blog yet. But I'll probably add it eventuallyâ„¢. For now, there's not much to see here. Currently I don't have any other posts that I can promote but if you liked reading this then feel free to share this blog, I'd appreciate it.</p>

    If I want something to work the way I want it to, I <strong>will</strong> try to find a way to make it work. Usually I would hunt forum posts or videos online for guides to do things, try it out, and see if things work. But sometimes... that can produce unintended results.

    I've probably broken stuff in countless ways by now, some examples are: Bricking a phone, accidentally wiping a drive, and so on, but that's all part of the learning process. If I didn't fail, I wouldn't have the knowledge and experience that I have today.
