                <p>After what seems like forever, I finally decided to post something for the first time on my blogpost.</p>

<h1 id="mcetoc_1i2teo7fa68">What is Umami?</h1>
<p>So, what is this Umami thing anyways? Umami is a FOSS (Free and Open-Source) and privacy-focused web analytics uhh.. thing. It helps web admins view visitor data and whatnot for their websites.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(and get a better explanation)</span>, you can check out their website <a href="https://umami.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i2teo7fa69">Why Umami?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not just use Google Analytics or CloudFlare like any other sane person?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you may wonder why I chose this over any other analytics solution like Google Analytics. It's because I care about my privacy and the privacy of visitors like you guys and gals who visit this website, plus, I'm not a big fan of Google anyways.</p>
<p>Another reason is that I can self-host Umami on my home server. I'll probably show my server some other time, but being able to self-host means that I control the data instead of some big corp. If you're curious, you can check out the analytics data over <a href="https://stats.jeffersontan.xyz/share/Dq1Qz7b4KYzxvSAb/jeffersontan.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="mcetoc_1i2tg2f5u8u">Conclusion</h1>
<p>So in short, Umami is an analytics platform that's free and respects users' privacy. I chose it because I don't want to use Google and because I can host Umami myself on my own server.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you guys think Umami is good? Or are there any better alternatives? Let me know, wait, you can't lol. I haven't added a comments system for this blog yet. But I'll probably add it eventuallyâ„¢. For now, there's not much to see here. Currently I don't have any other posts that I can promote but if you liked reading this then feel free to share this blog, I'd appreciate it.</p>

  <p class="align-center">
    If I want something to work the way I want it to, I <strong>will</strong> try to find a way to make it work. Usually I would hunt forum posts or videos online for guides to do things, try it out, and see if things work. But sometimes... that can produce unintended results.

    I've probably broken stuff in countless ways by now, some examples are: Bricking a phone, accidentally wiping a drive, and so on, but that's all part of the learning process. If I didn't fail, I wouldn't have the knowledge and experience that I have today.

    This is a website that I made for a high school project many years ago. It's coded using both HTML and CSS by hand, and since I used GitHub pages to host it, I learned a bit about code versioning.

    This is mainly a script that I wrote to help myself convert videos faster and with less effort, but anyone else are free to use it. Uses some code from my GPU detection script. It is currently a work in progress but the basics are there.

  <p class="align-center">
    If I'm not tinkering with computers (either software or hardware), I usually play games on my computer. What kind of games you may ask? Mostly racing games as I really like cars, but I do play other genres occasionally.
