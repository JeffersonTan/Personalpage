Well, usually if you want to play a game on Windows, you just press start. However, games aren't usually made with Linux in mind (especially for more popular titles). This is where Proton comes in.</p>\n<p>What is it you may ask? In simple terms, Proton is a compatibility layer that allows Windows programs to run on Linux and it works by translating Windows calls and APIs into something that Linux understands. It is actually based off a project called WINE (which funnily enough stands for WINE is not an emulator) that has patches and libraries added from Valve to improve performance for games.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1i3219b3015\">Why does it matter?</h2>\n<p>To make Windows games and programs work, Proton needs to create a \"prefix\" which is a small sandboxed environment that Windows programs run. Usually this prefix contains folder structures that looks similar to a Windows install but with much less stuff in them because Windows programs expect certain folders to exist at a certain location.</p>\n<p>If you're using Steam (which I assume you do), this prefix is usually located in this path:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/</code></pre>\n<p>It contains prefixes for all of your Steam games that requires Proton to run. For BeamNG specifically, it's located in a folder called \"284160\".</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1i32ae26f1q\">Actually installing the mods</h1>\n<p>From here on, the process for installing mods for BeamNG should be similar to how you install it on Windows.</p>\n<p>First, we head over to BeamNG's prefix folder:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code># Replace $USER with your username, of course\n/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c</code></pre>\n<p>In the drive_c folder, you'll notice a few familiar folders:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44.png\" alt=\"A picture of the folder structure inside the prefix.\" width=\"980\" height=\"180\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-xs.webp 300w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-sm.webp 480w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-md.webp 768w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-lg.webp 1024w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-xl.webp 1360w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-14-13-44-2xl.webp 1600w\">\n<figcaption >Windows system folder structure</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Next, we'll navigate to this path:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/284160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/BeamNG.drive/</code></pre>\n<p>If you've played previous versions of BeamNG before, you'll notice a few folders like this:</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45.png\" alt=\"Folders of different BeamNG versions\" width=\"642\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-xs.webp 300w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-sm.webp 480w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-md.webp 768w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-lg.webp 1024w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-xl.webp 1360w ,https://jeffersontan.xyz/media/posts/3/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-07-18-17-00-45-2xl.webp 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Folders named after the game's versions</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Then, open the folder for the latest version of the game and that's where your mods folder resides. You can then simply copy-paste or drag and drop your mods in the folder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wait, does this mean I can just migrate my mods from Windows?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep. You can copy all the mods you had from Windows if you're dual-booting Linux, or better yet, you can create a symlink so you don't have a bunch of duplicate files eating precious disk space.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>To summarise everything, installing mods for BeamNG in Linux isn't too different from Windows. The mods folder is located in a slightly different location and you can simply copy your desired mods into the folder.</p>",

It helps web admins view visitor data and whatnot for their websites.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to learn more <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">(and get a better explanation)</span>, you can check out their website <a href=\"https://umami.is/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1i2teo7fa69\">Why Umami?</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why not just use Google Analytics or CloudFlare like any other sane person?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some of you may wonder why I chose this over any other analytics solution like Google Analytics. It's because I care about my privacy and the privacy of visitors like you guys and gals who visit this website, plus, I'm not a big fan of Google anyways.</p>\n<p>Another reason is that I can self-host Umami on my home server. I'll probably show my server some other time, but being able to self-host means that I control the data instead of some big corp. If you're curious, you can check out the analytics data over <a href=\"https://stats.jeffersontan.xyz/share/Dq1Qz7b4KYzxvSAb/jeffersontan.xyz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1i2tg2f5u8u\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>So in short, Umami is an analytics platform that's free and respects users' privacy. I chose it because I don't want to use Google and because I can host Umami myself on my own server.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Do you guys think Umami is good? Or are there any better alternatives? Let me know, wait, you can't lol. I haven't added a comments system for this blog yet. But I'll probably add it eventuallyâ„¢. For now, there's not much to see here. Currently I don't have any other posts that I can promote but if you liked reading this then feel free to share this blog, I'd appreciate it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1i2tf120m6h\">Links and References</h1>\n<p>Here are all the important links in this page:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Umami - <a href=\"https://umami.is/\">https://umami.is/</a></li>\n<li>My analytics - <a href=\"https://stats.jeffersontan.xyz/share/Dq1Qz7b4KYzxvSAb/jeffersontan.xyz\">https://stats.jeffersontan.xyz/share/Dq1Qz7b4KYzxvSAb/jeffersontan.xyz</a></li>\n</ul>",
